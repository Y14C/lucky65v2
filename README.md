Weikav Lucky 65 V2 – QMK Source Code

This repository contains the source code for the Weikav Lucky 65 V2, a QMK-compatible mechanical keyboard.

⚠️ Important Note:
The original manufacturer of this keyboard is listed on the QMK violators list for not publicly providing their source code. I obtained this code directly through the supplier from whom I purchased the keyboard. The supplier assured me that this code was provided by the keyboard’s original engineer.

The repository primarily consists of C (.c) and header (.h) files required for QMK firmware development.

Please proceed with caution and verify the code as needed before use.
