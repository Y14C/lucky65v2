Weikav Lucky 65 V2 – QMK Source Code

This repository contains the source code for the Weikav Lucky 65 V2, a QMK-compatible mechanical keyboard.

⚠️ Important Note:
The original manufacturer of this keyboard is listed on the QMK violators list for not publicly providing their source code. I obtained this code directly through the supplier from whom I purchased the keyboard. The supplier assured me that this code was provided by the keyboard’s original engineer.

The repository primarily consists of C (.c) and header (.h) files required for QMK firmware development.

Please proceed with caution and verify the code as needed before use.

The zip file codebase-source-full-lucky65v2.zip was provided to me and i have uploaded it as is so you can use it to understand the directory strucutre.

Please freely download the zip file and make your own repo to maintain the code as i am just a user who bought the keeb and am not actually involved with the QMK team and their contributors.
